El Barto is the son of Glacial Storm--a Studmaster male and a son of PPPeruvian Augusto--and our light fawn Chilean import Dawn who has 22 micron fleece at the age of nine! He has gorgeous, crimpy, 19 micron fleece that won a ribbon at a fleece show. El Barto also won a ribbon at an AOBA-sanctioned confirmation show. . He has sired three cria for us, a white girl, a brown girl and a black boy! They all have nice fleece and handsome heads.
